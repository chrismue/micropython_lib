=== A simple Remote procedure call (RPC) implementation for MP ===
The aim of this project is to realize a simple RPC implementation for MicroPython (MP) 
to allow the easy usage of usage of classes runing on the MicroPython board but being 
controlled over some phy (Ethernet, Serial, WLAN...) and some marshalling (Json, XML, protobuf ..)
from the host (PC) side.
